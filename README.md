# neovim-dotfiles

This is a copy of the Braintree [vim-dotfiles](https://github.com/braintreeps/vim_dotfiles) repository, configured for Neovim specifically.

## Main differences

- Use [Lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) for managing plugins, and lazy-loading them.
- Use modern, maintained Neovim-variants of traditional Vim plugins.
